        "My Story",
        "Once upon a time, in the bustling world of high school, I was the merchant with pockets full of cash and dreams set on computers. Life was good until the day reality hit hard.It all began with a seemingly innocent suggestion from the principal: skip school on certain days for exams. Little did I know, those missed days would shatter my dream. When the results came in, those two missing subjects left my matric certificate incomplete, a haunting reminder of missed opportunities.Determined to pursue my passion for computers, I applied to the Life Choices Coding Academy. But my incomplete certificate was a barrier. Honesty led me to disclose the truth, leaving me disappointed and facing the daunting task of completing my certificate, a year-long process.Desperate to make ends meet, unemployed and disheartened, my grandmothers persistent nagging pushed me to seek employment. Months passed with no luck until a mysterious message led me to an agency that found me a job at Woolworths. It wasnt my dream, but it kept me afloat.</p>

          <p class="card-text fs-5">I began my working career at "GULF" an outsourcing company. <span>I was sent to Woolworths DC and appointes my first position as an Operations assistant. As an OPS assistant, I observed those working with computers in the office, sparking a desire to move up. I seized the chance for promotion, climbing slowly, learning, and adapting. Attempts to study ICT were thwarted by COVID, and my savings vanished, yet I persisted, continuously learning new skills during my night shifts.Persistence paid off when my extra efforts caught managements attention. The question that changed everything: Would you be interested in working in the office? I leaped at the chance, becoming the youngest and least experienced to hold that position in Woolworths history.But the glamour faded. The office felt like a scapegoat hub, a place to dump blame. Despite success, dissatisfaction brewed. I loved my job but detested the environment and the paycheck. Thats when I decided to reapply to the Life Choices Coding Academy, seeking a path back to my true passion.Now, despite the discontent, I'm still at Woolworths, surrounded by unbearable colleagues and insufficient pay. But being accepted into the coding academy again promises a new chapter, a chance to fulfill my dreams. The certainty of a clearer future keeps me going, knowing that soon, Ill be immersed in what Ive always yearned for, a life with computers.Its been a journey of setbacks, resilience, and unyielding determination. And now, as I step into this new chapter, the hope of finally merging passion and profession lights the way for"</span></p>
